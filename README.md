# Swiggy-Sales-Analysis---Using----SQL
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Swiggy's sales data using SQL to extract insights related to customers, restaurants, and delivery partners. The goal is to understand key business metrics, such as customer engagement, restaurant performance, and delivery partner efficiency, to help Swiggy make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview
In this project, I used SQL queries to perform various analyses on the Swiggy dataset. The project involves querying customer data, restaurant reviews and revenue, and delivery partner activity. Key findings include customer order trends, top-rated restaurants, and delivery partner efficiency.

## Problem Statements
### 1. Customer Analysis
* Display all customers who live in 'Delhi'.
* List all customers who have placed at least one order.
* Display the total number of orders placed by each customer.
* Find the number of orders placed by each customer in 'Mumbai'.
* Display all customers who have never placed an order.
* Display all orders placed in the last 30 days.
* Find the customers who have placed orders on exactly three different days.
* Identify customers who have the same city and have placed orders at the same restaurants, but on different dates.
### 2. Restaurant Analysis
* Find the average rating of all restaurants in 'Mumbai'.
* Find the total revenue generated by each restaurant.
* Find the top 5 restaurants with the highest average rating.
### 3. Delivery Partner Analysis
* List all delivery partners who have completed more than 1 delivery.
* Find the delivery partner who has worked with the most different customers.
# Key Insights
